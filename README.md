# languageTanslation-sentimentAnalysis
This project is made using python and is run using streamlit. This has two parts.
First is language translator. In this we input a sentence in english and specify the language to which it has to be translated into and it gets translated.
The second is analysing the sentiment of each sentence that is input. It displays if it is a positive, negative or neutral sentence.
